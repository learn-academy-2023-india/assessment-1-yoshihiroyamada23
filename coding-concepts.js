// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.
// There is no need to change any of the code.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain:

// --------------------1) What will this log?

const cohort = "LEARN 2023"
//console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: 10
// b) Verify and explain:
// looking at the syllabus under arrays.md, it shows how .length means how many indexs are from LEARN 2023
// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeting = "Hello World!"
//console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer: o
// b) Verify and explain: My answer is correct because looking at my notes, the [4] means we're looking at the letter o from hello

// --------------------3) What will this log?

const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
const index = 1
 //console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: ruby
// b) Verify and explain: the const index = 1 is telling me that we are looking for the idex of 1 and it is the same thing as console.log(languages[1]). 

// --------------------4) What will this log?

const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: "saturday" = "Saturday" and "sunday"= "Sunday"
// b) Verify and explain: The .toUppserCase() means that we are putting whatever is in [] to uppercase and I verified this through my notes and from the syllabus arrays.md. some reason it gave me an error.

// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean", "undefined"]
//  console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: i do not know the answer
// b) Verify and explain:
// the typeof operator is used to get the data type of aa variable or expression. the .lngth is a property that represents the number of elements in an array.

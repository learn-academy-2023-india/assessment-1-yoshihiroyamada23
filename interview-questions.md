# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:
I do not remember the answer to this.
Researched answer:
Git is a technology which uses any programming language or computer operating system. Whereas Github is a platform that uses git version control technology.

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The difference in an array's index and its value is that the index usually starts from 0 then goes to 1,2,3,... whereas, the value represents the information that is stored in the array.

Researched answer:
From my research, an array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. The key differentiates one element from another within the array. The primary difference between both is their roles within the data structure.
3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: arrays and strings are the same because you can put strings in an array but you can't put arrays in a string. Like const arrayOfStrings = ["pool"] but you can't do const ["pool"] = arrayOfStrings. 

Researched answer:
Arrays and strings are sequential data structures, meaning that their elements are stored in a specific order. Arrays can store elements of any data type, including numbers, characters, objects, etc. Strings are specifically designed to store sequences of characters.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: 
1. An abstraction is a form of simplification and organization, allowing developers to focus on the essential parts of their code without focusing on the implementation details. It helps developers create code in a more efficient manner, while still providing the same functionality.

2. Encapsulation is the process of combining data and codes into a single unit. It helps keep code organized, as well as helps prevent accidental data manipulation and changes.

3. Inheritance is the process of creating new classes based on an existing class. It allows the developer to create subclasses that will inherit the attributes and behaviors of the parent class. This makes it easy to reuse code, making development faster and more efficient.

4. Finally here in the Four pillars of OOPs, polymorphism is a form of abstraction that allows different classes to fulfill the same behavior. By taking advantage of polymorphism, developers can create code that is more easily maintained and more versatile.
## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher-order Functions:
Build in methoad in Javascript that takes in a function as an argument. Often higher-order functions are designed to operate on arrays. The function passed as an argument will execute once for every item in the array. This makes high-order functions incredible useful for iteration.  
ex.
.map (value, index, array)- iterates throough an array and returns a new array of the same length. 
.filter (value, index, array)- iterates through an array and returns a new array with only the values that satisfy the stated condition
2. Jest:
Made up of a collection of files a collection of files called dependencies which contain snippets of code functionality. Using all these code snippets together in the right way will give us the ability to run tests. There are many dependencies to manage and all need to work together in exactly the right way. This is a challenge on its own so in 2016 Facebook created a package manager called yarn to manage all the dependency files. A package manager will install dependencies, manage the dependencies, and give us the terminal commands to execute the tests.


3. Objects:
Objects are a Javascript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior.
